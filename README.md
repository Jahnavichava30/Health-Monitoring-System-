# Health-Monitoring-System

### Abstract 
This project presents an IoT-based patient health monitoring system that helps doctors track patients remotely in real time. Sensors measure temperature, heart rate, oxygen level, and EEG data. The Arduino collects and processes the data, displays it on an OLED screen, and sends it to the doctor through the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. This system helps provide quick medical attention and improves patient safety. Three users interact with the system: Patient, Doctor, and Administrator.

### Introduction 

IoT health monitoring systems allow continuous tracking of a patient’s health without needing them to stay in the hospital. These systems are low-cost, easy to install, and give real-time updates to doctors. By monitoring vital signs like heart rate and temperature, the system helps detect problems early and supports better treatment decisions.

### Requirements 
- Arduino IDE
- OLED Display
- MLX90614 Temperature Sensor
- AD8232 Pulse Sensor
- MAX30102 Oximeter
- Battery
- USB Cable
- Connecting Wires

### Conclusion:

With the wide use of internet, this work is concentrated to execute the internet technology to establish a system which would communicate through internet for better health. Internet of Things rules the whole world in various fields, mainly in health care sectors. Hence the present work is done to design an Internet of Things based smart patient health tracking system using an Arduino microcontroller. In this, pulse rate sensor is used to detect the heart beat and temperature sensor to read the temperature and sends the data to the cloud using internet. This information is also sent to the LCD display, so patient can easily know their health status. During critical situations to alert the doctor, the warning message is sent to the doctor’s phone and at the same time buzzer turns to alert the care taker. The doctor can view the sent data by logging the specific website or IP address.
